		Solution
	</h2work>
	<p2work>
		To appeal to a diverse audiece I branded Sprouter using simple icons. This allows people to become famillar with the brand quickly, because the icons and style are distinctly recognizeable. The opportunities to connect with other local users, and the ability to learn to grow and trade produce as a guest; encourage both frequent and irregular users to continue using Sprouter.

		Story
	</h2work>
	<p2work>
		When I was younger I always had an interest in growing plants. I loved to watch a seed transform into a full grown plant. However, I've never tried to grow anything myself. Now thath I'm older I've actually become vegetarian, and my interest in growing plants has increased with my change in lifestyle. The idea behind Sprouter, is to teach users about growing plants in order to capture their attention. Then while they are growing then can get access to others who are also growing locally. I thought it would be a perfect platform for people who’d like to have fresh fruits or vegetables at hand, and others who’d like to invest in homegrown produce in their community. I designed a platform that is a digital farmers market.

		Design Process
	</h2work>
	<p2work>
		This project started from a sustainability campaign, encouraging children to grow their own produce at home. The slogan was, “Grow Your Future”, and Sprouter was a promotional tool for the campaign. Sprouter’s name is based on the idea of people learning to grow produce, they wouldn’t be legitimate farmers while learning, they would be “Sprouters”. I created the logo mark for sprouter, by isolating the most prominent element from the Grow Your Future campaign mark, which was fruit hanging from a vine. In the original sketch above, the fruit was growing from a backpack. This was to represent how kids can use their own resources to grow their own food. 	</p2work>
		</div>
		<div class="rcp">
		<p2work>
		Moving forward from the campaign to the brand, I wanted to keep the same values of D.I.Y and sustainability. However, my main goals were to broaden the appeal to a larger audience and to make the brand appear trustworthy and knowledgable.

		Gill Sans is a clean san serif font. But, in italics the some of the letters terminate in flourished that match the lemon on the vine. Other letters have slanted terminals which lead the viewer’s eyes to the lemon emblem.

		The colors represent the  everything essential to plants, yellow is sunlight,  and blue water. The green represents the plants themselves.
