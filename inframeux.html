		Solution
	</h2work>
	<p2work>
		To illustrate the variety of people apart of the brand I designed a flexible branding system with a few simple elements, and used these different graphic elements from the mark to represent the different people who make up the brand's collaborative community. 	</p2work>

		Design Process
	</h2work>
	<p2work>
		When starting the wirerframing process, I focused on displaying a simple illustration of the brand’s goals and collaborative nature. This section is also an information slider which displays featured artwork. 	</p2work>
	</div>
	<div class="rcp">
	<p2work>
		During this time I experimented with the brands colors as well. I decided on a three color scheme to improve the contrast of different elements in the mark and in my layouts. When I finished refining the desktop and mobile layouts, I created a style guide using the elements from the web collateral. 	</p2work>

	<p2work>
		I was inspired to create this project because I see a need for artist to be able to collaborate with subjects who have large followings, and vice versa. I also see a need people to support with public figures they follow. To satisfy these needs I created a brand that provides direct support to an innovative community of artists, and subjects.

		These first prototypes, bring sharper definition the content areas laid out in my wireframes. This was also the first use of the three color scheme I had chosen. The feedback I received from these prototypes, sparked my idea for a four color scheme, and the photo treatments I developed.

		These photo treatments are essential to the  style Inframe represents. They  are used to showcase the artworks and the artists who create them. I emulated the brand by using the slanted box shape from the mark, and an opacity with the brand's tan color. I also used different groupings to show users similar artworks/artists  or a wider variety of different artworks/artist. The single photo arrangement keeps the photo treatments consistent when focusing on one artwork or artist.
