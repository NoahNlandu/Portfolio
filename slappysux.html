		In order to  present all the information clearly, I used separated content sections, within a flexible layout. Each section has an optional content slider, so users can slide through content in the selected sections for additional information. 	</p2work>

		Design Process
	</h2work>
	<p2work>
		I researched web sites of local skate shops, and other skateboard brands to compare the information they present users. I consistently saw webpages that highlighted options to view and purchase product, but negleted presenting information about where to buy products, and who are the skateboarders associated with the brand. 
	</p2work>
	</div>
	<div class="rc">
	<p2work>
		Slappy’s Garage is a skate shop that has been built for the local (San Diego) community, and the web experience of the skate shop needs to match this. When creating wireframes I focused on giving users easy access to information, by using large content sections. As I began to prototylpe I made sure these content areas were used to give users information about how find the shop, and connect with the skateboarding community.  	</p2work>

		The Story
	</h2work>
	<p2work>
		As I was working with the branding system for Remeber This, the Slappy’s Garage skateboard film, I saw an opportunity to design touchpoints for the skate shop using the same branding. In my research, I learned that Slappy’s Garage hasn’t invested in creating a strong web presence, because they’ve seized an opportunity to open a new location near a cutting edge skatepark. However, this was an opportunity for me to match their web presence and business goals, by using the website to highlight their multiple locations, and the skateboard team who attract skateboarders from the local and global community.	</p2work></div>

		These prototypes, are my first attempts designing the responsive website home and shop pages. I emphasized the store to be at the forefront of the hompage, however, after receiving feedback from my peers, I saw needed to bring more opportunities for users to learn more about the people involved with Slappy’s Garage as well. As you can see I made the change and brought more emphasis to the skateboard team when I designed the desktop pages.
